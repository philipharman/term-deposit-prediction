This project is intended to develop a logistic regression model using Scikit-Learn to predict if banking clients will subscribe to a term deposit (based on select client information).
- *Session_2_Logistic_Regression_EXERCISE.ipynb*: Data exploration and model development
- *deployed_logreg.py*: File for deployed Streamlit application
- Final application published using Heroku, which is available here: https://term-deposit-prediction.herokuapp.com/
